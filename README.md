Prodigy Data Science Internship Task-1

TASK-1:
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

Sample Dataset: [World Bank Population Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)

*Note: It's not compulsory to use the provided dataset.*

Here is my proposed solution for the Prodigy visualization task:

1. Data Cleaning: I performed data cleaning within Tableau itself. You can observe the presence of null values in the initial dataset before the cleaning process in the video linked below my solution.
2. Filter Application: I applied filters to display the population data for the year 2004 in the form of a bar graph, showing only populations greater than one billion.
3. Histogram Comparison: I also included a histogram solution, both before and after removing null values, for comparison.
